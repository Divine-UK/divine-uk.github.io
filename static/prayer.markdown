Abba Father, Lord Jesus, Holy Spirit, I praise you, I thank you and I worship you. Lord Jesus I thank you for all the blessings you have given me.  I surrender my intellect, my mind, and my memory into your hands.  Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, send the Holy Spirit upon me.  O Holy Spirit, come into my heart, come into my mind, come into my intellect to enlighten me so that I may study well.  Holy Spirit, my helper, fill me with your wisdom, knowledge and understanding.  Spirit of Jesus, give me a good memory so that I might be able to understand and remember what I am going to study now.  O Holy Spirit, I need you, come into me.  Thank you, Father, thank you Jesus, thank you Holy Spirit. 
(Our Father, Hail Mary and Glory beâ€¦)
